# Hydra Renderer Info

## Abstract

Hydra Renderer is a general purpose photo realistic rendering system. It is open source and free for commertial and non commetrial usage. It can run both on CPUs and GPUs (however, GPUs are preferred). We position our system as one of the most efficient renderer in the world for complex light transport simulation phenomena. Our main advantages are bidirectional and Markov chain rendering algorithms. We also have elaborated API that allow customer/use easily integrate Hydra
